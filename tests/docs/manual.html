<h1>SMPlayer</h1>
<p>SMPlayer is a fully featured front-end for <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html">MPlayer</a>, an award-winning open source media player supporting popular video and audio formats such as H.264, DVD, (S)VCDs, DivX, & MP3. SMPlayer is written under the Qt platform and is available for Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux opertaing systems. There's an optional package available called smplayer-themes. It contains some icon themes for smplayer and it's highly recommended that you install it too.</p>
<p>SMPlayer Portable Edition is a special version of SMPlayer (for Windows) which tries to not write anything outside from the directory where it is installed, so it can be used from external devices like pendrives. You can get a package from here:<br>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/smplayer/files/SMPlayer">https://sourceforge.net/projects/smplayer/files/SMPlayer</a></p>
<p>To install it, just uncompress it wherever you want. To run it just double click on smplayer.exe.</p>
<p>Differences from the normal SMPlayer:</p>
<p>* By default it will save the ini files in the SMPlayer's folder.<br>
* It won't try to create the SMPlayer home directory or the screenshot
  directory (C:\Documents and Settings\User\.smplayer\...)<br>
* It won't write anything in the Windows registry (for that reason the
  file associations are not available in this version)<br>
* The screenshot option is disabled by default.</p>
<p>To identify whether you are running the portable edition,go to Help -> About SMPlayer, it should say something like this: "Version: 0.8.0 (Portable Edition)"</p>
<p>SMTube is a browser for searching for, recording and launching YouTubeâ„¢ videos within SMPlayer. SMTube is derived from <a href="http://www.umplayer.com/">UMPlayer</a>.</p>

<h4><span id="#usage">Usage</span></h4>
<p>SMPlayer supports command line parameters that can be called while launching SMPlayer from either a shortcut or a command line environment. These are useful for advanced users who want to change the default behavior when launching SMPlayer or used by SMPlayer internally. For most users, it is unnecessary to worry about any of these.</p>
<pre>
Usage: <b>smplayer [-minigui] [-defaultgui] [-mpcgui] [-config-path directory] [-send-action action_name] [-actions action_list]
[-close-at-end] [-no-close-at-end] [-fullscreen] [-no-fullscreen] [-sub subtitle_file] [-pos x y] [-size width height]
[-add-to-playlist] [-help|--help|-h|-?] [media] [media]...</b>

<b>-uninstall</b>       Restores the old associations and cleans up the registry.
<b>-minigui</b>         Opens the mini gui instead of the default one.
<b>-mpcgui</b>          Opens the mpc gui.
<b>-defaultgui</b>      Opens the default gui.
<b>-config-path</b>     Specifies the directory where SMPlayer will store its configuration files (smplayer.ini, smplayer_files.ini...)
<b>-send-action</b>     Tries to make a connection to another running instance and send to it the specified action.

                 Example: -send-action pause

                 The rest of the options (if any) will be ignored and the application will exit. It will return 0 on success or -1 on
                 failure.
<b>-actions</b>         A list of actions separated by spaces. The actions will be executed just after loading the file (if any) in the same
                 order you entered. For checkable actions you can pass true or false as parameter.
                 
                 Example: -actions "fullscreen compact true"
                 
                 Quotes are necessary in case you pass more than one action.
<b>-close-at-end</b>    The main window will be closed when the file/playlist finishes.
<b>-no-close-at-end</b> The main window won't be closed when the file/playlist finishes.
<b>-fullscreen</b>      The video will be played in fullscreen mode.
<b>-no-fullscreen</b>   The video will be played in window mode.
<b>-sub</b>             Specifies the subtitle file to be loaded for the first video.
<b>-pos</b>             Specifies the coordinates where the main window will be displayed.
<b>-size</b>            Specifies the size of the main window.
<b>-help</b>            Shows this message and then will exit.
<b>-add-to-playlist</b> If there's another instance running, the media will be added to that instance's playlist. If there's no other instance,
                 this option will be ignored and the files will be opened in a new instance. 
<b>media</b>            'media' is any kind of file that SMPlayer can open. It can be a local file, a DVD (e.g. dvd://1), an Internet stream
                 (e.g. mms://....) or a local playlist in format m3u or pls.
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>There are some behaviors in the SMPlayer GUI that may not be obvious:</p>
<ul><li>Stop button. Pressing the Stop button once stops the video. If you press Play, the video will resume at the same point. But if you press Stop twice the time position is reset to 0, so Play will start the video from the beginning.</li>
<li>The pause button. The first time you click on it, the video is paused. The following times it will step to the next frame. This behavior only occurs with the pause button, not with the pause option in the menu.</li>

<li>Double clicking in the video window toggles fullscreen.</li>

<li>The Esc key can be used to exit from fullscreen mode.</li>

<li>The O key switches OSD modes (the same way MPlayer does)</li>

<li>The option Open->URL doesn't check if you really typed a URL. What
you type is passed to mplayer. So you may use this option to play not
supported yet media, for instance TV channels, VCD, or anything
supported by mplayer.</li>

<li>You can use the mouse wheel to go forward or backward.</li>

<li>Probably you'll have noticed that when you select some options the
video window goes black for a moment and then resumes. This is because
smplayer has to stop mplayer and start it again (with new options) and
cannot be avoided.</li>

<li>If you play a DVD you'll see that smplayer won't save the settings
(audio, subtitles and so on), so if you play it again later you will
have to select your desired options again. Some time ago, smplayer did
save the settings for DVDs but I removed it. Reasons: resuming playback
at the same point is not possible (mplayer fault, it doesn't report the
actual current time) and the disc had to be read twice, one for
identifying it and other for starting playback. That could be very slow.</li>

<li>Deinterlace. MPlayer has a lot of deinterlace filters. I have chosen 3
for smplayer: 

 * Lowpass5 (pp=l5). Works well most of the time, even with divx videos
 which have been badly deinterlaced. But this filter produces some "ghost"
 effect in movement scenes.

 * Yadif. It seems it works very well with mpeg files at full
 resolution. No ghosting, but some times the movement is not smooth. The
 bad part is that uses a lot of CPU.

 * Linear Blend (pp=lb). Produces a lot of ghosting and blurs the
 image.</li>

<li>Video filters:

 * Autodetect phase.  Most movies and TV series (in PAL world) are not
 interlaced but progressive. But maybe in the computer they may seem
 interlaced (this happens to me sometimes with my dvd recorder). It
 seems that those videos have a field changed or shifted or something
 like that. "Autodetect phase" fixes it (-vf phase=A).

 * Denoise. This filter removes noise from the image, making it
 cleaner. But it could also remove a lot of details...

 * Deblock. If the blocks of a video are very noticeable this filter
 could help a little bit.

 * Dering. Actually I don't know what this filter does...

 * Add noise. Add a little bit of noise to the image. Can be useful to
 "cover" the blocks with noise or after a denoise, so the image doesn't
 look so extremely clean.</li>
