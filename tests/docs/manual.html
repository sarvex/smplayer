<h1>SMPlayer</h1>
<p>SMPlayer is a fully featured front-end for <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html">MPlayer</a>, an award-winning open source media player supporting popular video and audio formats such as H.264, DVD, (S)VCDs, DivX, & MP3. SMPlayer is written under the Qt platform and is available for Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux opertaing systems. There's an optional package available called smplayer-themes. It contains some icon themes for smplayer and it's highly recommended that you install it too.</p>
<p>SMPlayer Portable Edition is a special version of SMPlayer (for Windows) which tries to not write anything outside from the directory where it is installed, so it can be used from external devices like pendrives. You can get a package from here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/smplayer/files/SMPlayer">https://sourceforge.net/projects/smplayer/files/SMPlayer</a></p>
<p>To install it, just uncompress it wherever you want. To run it just double click on smplayer.exe.</p>
<p>Differences from the normal SMPlayer:</p>
<p>* By default it will save the ini files in the SMPlayer's folder.<br>
* It won't try to create the SMPlayer home directory or the screenshot directory (C:\Documents and Settings\User\.smplayer\...)<br>
* It won't write anything in the Windows registry (for that reason the file associations are not available in this version)<br>
* The screenshot option is disabled by default.</p>
<p>To identify whether you are running the portable edition,go to Help -> About SMPlayer, it should say something like this: "Version: 0.8.0 (Portable Edition)"</p>
<p>SMTube is a browser for searching for, recording and launching YouTubeâ„¢ videos within SMPlayer. SMTube is derived from <a href="http://www.umplayer.com/">UMPlayer</a>.</p>

<h4><span id="usage">Usage</span></h4>
<p>SMPlayer supports command line parameters that can be called while launching SMPlayer from either a shortcut or a command line environment. These are useful for advanced users who want to change the default behavior when launching SMPlayer or used by SMPlayer internally. For most users, it is unnecessary to worry about any of these.</p>
<pre>
Usage: <b>smplayer [-minigui] [-defaultgui] [-mpcgui] [-config-path directory] [-send-action action_name] [-actions action_list]
[-close-at-end] [-no-close-at-end] [-fullscreen] [-no-fullscreen] [-sub subtitle_file] [-pos x y] [-size width height]
[-add-to-playlist] [-help|--help|-h|-?] [media] [media]...</b>

<b>-uninstall</b>       Restores the old associations and cleans up the registry.
<b>-minigui</b>         Opens the mini gui instead of the default one.
<b>-mpcgui</b>          Opens the mpc gui.
<b>-defaultgui</b>      Opens the default gui.
<b>-config-path</b>     Specifies the directory where SMPlayer will store its configuration files (smplayer.ini, smplayer_files.ini...)
<b>-send-action</b>     Tries to make a connection to another running instance and send to it the specified action.

                 Example: -send-action pause

                 The rest of the options (if any) will be ignored and the application will exit. It will return 0 on success or -1 on
                 failure.
<b>-actions</b>         A list of actions separated by spaces. The actions will be executed just after loading the file (if any) in the same
                 order you entered. For checkable actions you can pass true or false as parameter.
                 
                 Example: -actions "fullscreen compact true"
                 
                 Quotes are necessary in case you pass more than one action.
<b>-close-at-end</b>    The main window will be closed when the file/playlist finishes.
<b>-no-close-at-end</b> The main window won't be closed when the file/playlist finishes.
<b>-fullscreen</b>      The video will be played in fullscreen mode.
<b>-no-fullscreen</b>   The video will be played in window mode.
<b>-sub</b>             Specifies the subtitle file to be loaded for the first video.
<b>-pos</b>             Specifies the coordinates where the main window will be displayed.
<b>-size</b>            Specifies the size of the main window.
<b>-help</b>            Shows this message and then will exit.
<b>-add-to-playlist</b> If there's another instance running, the media will be added to that instance's playlist. If there's no other instance,
                 this option will be ignored and the files will be opened in a new instance. 
<b>media</b>            'media' is any kind of file that SMPlayer can open. It can be a local file, a DVD (e.g. dvd://1), an Internet stream
                 (e.g. mms://....) or a local playlist in format m3u or pls.
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>There are some behaviors in SMPlayer that may not be obvious:</p>
<ul><li>Stop button. Pressing the Stop button once stops the video. If you press Play, the video will resume at the same point. But if you press Stop twice the time position is reset to 0, so Play will start the video from the beginning.</li>
<li>Pause button. The first time you click on it, the video is paused. The following times it will step to the next frame. This behavior only occurs with the pause button, not with the pause option in the menu.</li>
<li>Double clicking in the video window toggles fullscreen.</li>
<li>The Esc key can be used to exit from fullscreen mode.</li>
<li>The O key switches OSD modes (the same way MPlayer does).</li>
<li>The option Open->URL doesn't check if you really typed a URL. What you type is passed to MPlayer. So you may use this option to play not supported yet media, for instance TV channels, Blu-ray, or anything supported by MPlayer.</li>
<li>You can use the mouse wheel to go forward or backward.</li>
<li>
<p>Deinterlace. MPlayer has a lot of deinterlace filters. I have chosen 3 for SMPlayer: 
<p><b>Lowpass5 (pp=l5).</b> Works well most of the time, even with divx videos which have been badly deinterlaced. But this filter produces some "ghost" effect in movement scenes.</p>
<p><b>Yadif.</b> It seems it works very well with mpeg files at full resolution. No ghosting, but some times the movement is not smooth. The bad part is that uses a lot of CPU.</p>
<p><b>Linear Blnd (pp=lb).</b> Produces a lot of ghosting and blurs the image.</p>
</p>
</li>
<li>Video filters:
<p>
<p><b>Autodetect phase.</b>  Most movies and TV series (in PAL world) are not interlaced but progressive. But maybe in the computer they may seem interlaced (this happens to me sometimes with my dvd recorder). It seems that those videos have a field changed or shifted or something like that. "Autodetect phase" fixes it (-vf phase=A).</p>
<p><b>Denoise.</b> This filter removes noise from the image, making it cleaner. But it could also remove a lot of details...</p>
<p><b>Deblock.</b> If the blocks of a video are very noticeable this filter could help a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Dering.</b> The dering filter is available for mencoder mpeg-4 and xvid codecs. It reduces ring-type artifacts present in the source movie.</p>
<p><b>Add noise.</b> Add a little bit of noise to the image. Can be useful to "cover" the blocks with noise or after a denoise, so the image doesn't look so extremely clean.</p></li></p>
</ul>
<h4><span id="features">Features</span></h4>

<h5><span id="features_favs">Favorties List</span></h5>
<p>SMPlayer 0.7.0 adds a new Favorites menu. It can be accessed by the Open-&gt;Favorites option or the Favorites icon in the toolbar. You can add multiple submenus. Currently it cannot bookmark a specific time in a video.</p>

<h5><span id="features_plist">Playlist</span></h5>
<p></p>

<h5><span id="features_tv">Television (Linux)</span></h5>
<p>Since 0.6.8 it's possible to watch the TV in SMPlayer (dvb:// and tv://).

<p>SMPlayer doesn't include any option to scan for channels, so mplayer must be configured to tune to TV channels.</p>

<p>That means that the following:</p>

<pre>mplayer dvb://
mplayer tv://</pre><p></p>

<p>should work (should display a TV channel).</p>

<p>The following should tune to the specified channel:</p>

<pre>mplayer dvb://Channel_name
mplayer tv://Channel_name</pre><p></p>

<p><b>DVB</b>: The support for SVB in SMPlayer is intented for DVB-T (terrestrial). It can work with DVB-C and DVB-S (cable and satellite) but it hasn't been tested.</p>

<p>SMPlayer will look for the file ~/.mplayer/channels.conf.ter (or ~/.mplayer/channels.conf if that doesn't exist), and the menus Open->TV and Open->Radio will be populated with the channels there (the menu Open->Radio will show the channels without video pid. Notice that for dvb-s and dvb-c the check for audio and video pids will probably fail and all channels will end up in the TV menu).</p>

<p>If you don't have a ~/.mplayer/channels.conf you can create with scan (in Ubuntu is in the dvb-apps package):</p>

<pre>scan initial_file > ~/.mplayer/channels.conf</pre><p></p>

<p>The initial_file contains info about the frequencies that have to be scanned, you'll find a lot in /usr/share/dvb/dvb-t/ (use the one for your town). You can also use w_scan, which doesn't require any initial file.</p>


<p><b>TV</b>: The support for analog TV (tv://) in SMPlayer is very basic  (it can recognize a tv:// stream as being a TV channel, but that's all) and configuration has to be done manually.</p>

<p>First you need some lines in your ~/.mplayer/config with the TV configuration (driver, norms, frequencies...). Example:</p>

<pre>tv=driver=v4l:input=0:width=768:height=576:device=/dev/video0:audiorate=48000:n
orm=PAL:chanlist=europe-west:channels=46-TV_1,43-TV_2,50-TV_3,53-TV_4</pre><p></p>

<p>For more info take a look at the MPlayer manpage.</p>

<p>After that you have to introduce all channels in SMPlayer (Open->TV->Edit).</p>

<p><u>Channel Editor</u></p>

<p>The channel editor allows you to add, modify and remove TV channels. You'll see a table with all channels. Each channel contains 3 fields: icon, name and stream. The name will appear in the menu, the stream is what MPlayer will open to tune the channel. Examples:</p>

<pre>ICON   NAME          STREAM
       CNN           dvb://CNN
       BBC           tv://TV_1
       Webcam        tv://</pre><p></p>

<p>The list of TV channels is saved to ~/.config/smplayer/tv.m3u8, while the list of radio is saved to ~/.config/smplayer/radio.m3u8.</p>

<p>Note 1: By default SMPlayer will scan the file ~/.mplayer/channels.conf on every startup and will add the new channels it finds there. That means that if you delete DVB channels from the editor they will appear again in the next session (SMPlayer will think they are new). To avoid that, there's an option in Preferences->TV to disable the scanning of the channels.conf file.</p>

<p>Note 2: It's possible to set an icon for each channel. The icon will be displayed in the menus. Currently it's possible to set an icon, change it
but there's no way to remove it... (unless you edit manually the *.m3u8 files)</p>

<p>Note 3: The TV and radio lists can be "misused" as favorite lists, you can enter any other kind of media (internet streams, local files...) not only tv channels.</p>

<p><u>Options for TV</u></p>

<p>Some options have been added for TV:</p>
<ul>
 <li>there's a new section for TV in Preferences, which allows for instance to set the default deinterlacer to be use with TV channels.</li>
 <li>it's possible to set a cache for TV in Preferences -> Performance -> Cache</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><u>Remembering TV Settings</u></p>

<p>One nice thing: the settings of TV channels are remembered. That means that filters, options (like zoom) and so on will be remembered when you tune that channel again.</p>

<p><u>(Advanced) Additional Audio Tracks in DVB Channels</u></p>

<p>You'll notice that when you tune a dvb channel only the first audio track is available. To fix the problem you need to add manually the additional audio pids to channels.conf. For instance, take a look at this line taken from ~/.mplayer/channels.conf:</p>

<pre>ANTENA.NEOX:858000000:INVERSION_AUTO:BANDWIDTH_8_MHZ:FEC_2_3:FEC_2_3:QAM_64:TRANSMISSION_MODE_8K:GUARD_INTERVAL_1_4:HIERARCHY_NONE:501:503:141</pre><p></p>

<p>Let's see the 3 last fields:</p>
<pre>501:503:141</pre><p></p>

<p>501 is the video pid, 503 is the audio pid (and 141 I think is the teletext pid). Several audio pids can be added separated by "+". For instance:</p>

<pre>501:503+504:141</pre><p></p>

<p>This way the 2nd audio track (504) will be available when you watch that channel in SMPlayer. Notice that to be able to actually switch audio tracks in DVB channels you need a recent version of MPlayer (r29381).
</p>

<h5><span id="features_dvdmenus">DVD Menus</span></h5>
<p>SMPlayer 0.6.7 adds the possibility to display DVD menus.</p>
<p>In order to enable, you need to enable the option "Enable DVD menus (experimental)" in Preferences-&gt;Drives.
</ul>
<p>A recent MPlayer build with dvdnav support is required (usually included with SMPlayer).</p>
<p>Note that cache will be automatically DISABLED (DVD menus won't work with it) so this can affect performance.</p>
<p>WARNING: support for DVD menus is EXPERIMENTAL and NOT complete yet. Currently MPlayer has a lot of issues/limitations when using dvdnav, and it doesn't make things easy for front-ends, so the support for the DVD menus in SMPlayer can't be improved any further for the moment.</p>

<h5><span id="features_subs">Subtitles</span></h5>
<p>SMPlayer 0.6.2 adds a new dialog which allows you to find subtitle files very easily. The dialog can be opened with the option "Find subtitles on OpenSubtitles.org" in the Subtitles menu. It will automatically look for subtitles for the video you're currently playing (or the previous video if none is playing).</p>

<p>The search is not done based on the file's name but on a hash which is calculated from the file, so it doesn't matter if you renamed the file, it will find the right subtitles for the file. To download a subtitle, just double click on it or click on the Download button. It will automatically download the subtitle into the same directory as the video. Make sure you have write access where the video resides or else the download will not be successful.</p>

<p>You can also upload subtitles to OpenSubtitles.org, you'll find an option for that in the Subtitles menu. That would just open a web page with an upload form (Java required).</p>

<h5><span id="features_help">Integrated Help</span></h5>
<p>SMPlayer comes with help built-in for each option in the Preferences. Hover your cursor over an option to view a detailed explanation of that option.</p>

<h4><span id="kial">Known Issues & Limitations</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Probably you'll have noticed that when you select some options the video window goes black for a moment and then resumes. This is because SMPlayer has to stop MPlayer and start it again (with new options) and cannot be avoided.</li>
<li>If you play a DVD you'll see that SMPlayer won't save the settings (audio, subtitles and so on), so if you play it again later you will have to select your desired options again. Some time ago, SMPlayer did save the settings for DVDs but I removed it. Reasons: resuming playback at the same point is not possible (MPlayer fault, it doesn't report the actual current time) and the disc had to be read twice, one for identifying it and other for starting playback. That could be very slow.</li>
<li>DVD Menus: it seems there's no way to know the current title that it's playing. MPlayer prints a line like this "DVDNAV, switched to title: 1" but unfortunately the title number that appears there may not match the title IDs that MPlayer printed before (it may say "switched to title 2" but the actual title may be the 12th). As SMPlayer doesn't know the title, restoring the previous position after a mplayer restart is impossible.</li>
<li>DVD Menus: if the audio track is changed, when you return to the dvd menu the sound may be lost (while printing a lot of error messages "Too many video packets in the buffer").</li>
<li>DVD Menus: subtitles may disappear after seeking.</li>
</ul>
