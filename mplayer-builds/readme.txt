These are some notes that I'm writing with the steps I'm doing when compiling 
mplayer under windows (both mingw and cygwin): packages I downloaded, how they
were compiled. There are also some patches I used.

Currently this is mainly for myself (I used the svn because this way it's easy
to share it between computers) but in the future maybe it could be used to
write some guide or howto.
