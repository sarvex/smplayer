The following document will explain how to build the above package, in case you prefer to compile mplayer yourself.

First let's install Subversion and other packages we're going to need:

[code]sudo apt-get install subversion devscripts fakeroot[/code]
Now we create a directory to save the mplayer sources:
[code]mkdir mplayer
cd mplayer[/code]
Download the mplayer sources from svn:
[code]svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/trunk svn[/code]
Now we're going to download the patches we'll use later:

[code]wget http://smplayer.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/smplayer/mplayer-builds/patches-ubuntu/create_deb.diff
wget http://smplayer.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/smplayer/mplayer-builds/patches-ubuntu/debian.diff
wget http://smplayer.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/smplayer/mplayer-builds/patches/startupvol.diff
wget http://smplayer.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/smplayer/mplayer-builds/patches/patcheq.diff
wget http://smplayer.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/smplayer/mplayer-builds/patches/ass_support_for_mencoder.patch[/code]
Now we download and install all build dependencies for mplayer (this may take a while, it may download up to 37 MB):
[code]cd svn
sudo apt-get build-dep mplayer[/code]
Now we're going to patch the mplayer sources (be sure you're in the [i]svn[/i] directory):
[code]patch -p0 -E -i ../debian.diff
patch -p0 -E -i ../create_deb.diff
patch -p0 -E -i ../startupvol.diff
patch -p0 -E -i ../patcheq.diff
patch -p0 -E -i ../ass_support_for_mencoder.patch[/code]
Now we're ready to start to compile. But first, let's give the script [i]create_deb.sh[/i] executable permissions:
[code]chmod 755 create_deb.sh[/code]
Finally, let's compile mplayer:
[code]./create_deb.sh[/code]
That'll take some minutes, depending on your processor's speed.

Now we can install the package:
[code]cd ..
sudo dpkg -i mplayer_1.0rc2svn27483_i386.deb[/code]
If it complains about missing dependencies, just let's install them with apt-get.
[code]sudo apt-get install mplayer-skins[/code]
