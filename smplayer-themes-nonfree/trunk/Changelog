Version 0.1.1

 * Revision 1821 of smplayer adds a new icon for Play/Pause (play_pause.png).
   That breaks all icon themes (the new icon appears in all themes). As a
   quick fix, I've just created a play_pause.png in all themes, which is just
   a copy of play.png.

Version 0.1.0
 * First version.
