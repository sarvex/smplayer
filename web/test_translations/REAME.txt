Well, this is how it works:

First it's needed to include in every page this code at the beginning:
[code]
<?php
include_once("l10n.php");
?>
[/code]

Now every translatable string should be written this way:
[code]
<?php tr("This text can be translated."); ?>
[/code]

Another example, with a link:
[code]
tr("This is a <a href=\"download/smplayer_0.5.61.tar.gz\">link</a>.");
[/code]

But for links and other non translatable texts, but which may vary (like
version numbers) it's better to use the following:
[code]
tr("This is another <a href=\"%1\">link</a>.", "download/smplayer_0.5.61.tar.gz");
[/code]

The text that the translator will see is: [i]"This is another <a href=\"%1\">link</a>."[/i]

The "%1" will be replaced with the 2nd argument in tr(). The good of this, 
you can update the link later and the translation will still be valid.

It's possible to add up to 4 additional arguments. An example using 2:
[code]
tr("The latest version is %1. You can get it <a href=\"%2\">here</a>.", "0.5.61", "download/smplayer_0.5.61.tar.gz");
[/code]

How to create a translation? 
Easy. In the translation subdirectory there's a Makefile. In the FILES line
there should be listed all web pages. Just simply it's needed to type [i]make[/i]
in that directory to get updated *.po files that translators could translate.
