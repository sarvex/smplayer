<b>0.7.1:</b>
<p>
This version includes some bug fixes, some of them important. 
It's highly recommended to update.
<p>
Fixes:
<ul>
<li>
SMPlayer took more than 10 seconds to show when running for the very first 
time.
</li>
<li>
The links to download subtitles from Opensubtitles were wrong.
</li>
<li>
SMPlayer crashed in the favorite editor when trying to select a file 
if the KDE open dialog was used.
<li>
Some translations were missing in the Windows package.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
New:
<ul>
<li>
By default the screenshots are saved in the user's pictures folder
instead of the SMPlayer's config folder.
</li>
<li>
Now it's possible to change the opensubtitles server.
</li>
<li>
Youtube: seeking is slow with flv videos, so now flv videos have the
lowest priority.
</li>
<li>
Youtube: now it's possible to search and download videos from youtube.
This is provided by an external application (in linux you have to
install an independent package: smtube).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>0.7.0:</b>
<ul>
<li>
 New favorite menu, where you can add your favorite videos, music, streams,
 youtube videos... It's also possible to add submenus.

 dragging a link from a browser to the smplayer window.
</li>

<li>
  Support for mplayer2 (http://www.mplayer2.org). It's a fork of mplayer with
  interesting features like precise seeking, ordered chapters in mkv videos and
  better pause handling (e.g. seek works while the video is paused).
