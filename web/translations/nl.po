#: ../faq.php:71
msgid ""
"They are two different applications that work together. SMPlayer\n"

"keyboard. As this is not very user friendly, several graphical\n"
"interfaces have been developed, and SMPlayer is one of them. So MPlayer\n"
"is the playback engine, SMPlayer adds the buttons, menus, dialogs, and so\n"
"on. The Windows packages already include a MPlayer build along with\n"
"SMPlayer."

#: ../faq.php:86
msgid ""
"It means that the installer includes a \"promotional screen\" from a\n"

#: ../faq.php:108
msgid ""
"Multithreaded decoding requires a recent build of MPlayer or FFmpeg-mt\n"
